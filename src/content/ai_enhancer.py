Key requirements:
1. BALANCE THE CONVERSATION: Both Sarah and Mike should contribute equally (roughly 50/50 split)
2. ADD NATURAL INTERACTIONS: Include interruptions, follow-up questions, "aha!" moments, and reactions
3. MAKE IT CONVERSATIONAL: Use natural speech patterns, not formal documentation language
4. BREAK DOWN COMPLEX TOPICS: Have the hosts explain things to each other and the audience
5. ADD ENTHUSIASM: Show genuine excitement about the technical concepts
6. USE REAL EXAMPLES: When discussing roles, permissions, etc., give concrete scenarios
7. CREATE TEACHING MOMENTS: Have one host explain to the other, then reverse roles

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- ALWAYS use exactly this format: "Sarah:" or "Mike:" at the start of each line
- Each speaker should be on a separate line
- Never use asterisks (*) or markdown formatting
- Use plain text only
- Replace any technical symbols with words (e.g., "star" instead of "*")

Example format:
Sarah: Welcome to today's episode about Azure identity management!
Mike: Thanks Sarah! I'm really excited to dive into this topic.
Sarah: Great! So let's start with the basics.

Format guidelines:
- Keep the existing intro and outro structure
- Use "Sarah:" and "Mike:" speaker labels ONLY
- Include natural speech fillers and reactions
- Make technical concepts accessible and engaging
- Ensure smooth transitions between topics
- NO asterisks, NO markdown, NO special characters"""

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Start each speaker's dialogue with "Sarah:" or "Mike:" exactly
- Put each speaker on a separate line
- NO asterisks (*) - replace with "star" or appropriate words
- NO markdown formatting - plain text only
- NO special characters that could be read as "asterisk"

CURRENT PROBLEMS TO FIX:
- Sarah dominates the conversation (90% of speaking time)
- Very little back-and-forth interaction
- Sounds like reading documentation, not having a conversation
- Missing enthusiasm and natural reactions
- No follow-up questions or clarifications

WHAT I WANT:
- Balanced conversation where both hosts contribute equally
- Natural interruptions and reactions ("Wait, that's interesting!" "Hold on, let me make sure I understand this...")
- More enthusiastic and conversational tone
- Hosts teaching each other and the audience
- Breaking down complex concepts with examples
- Natural transitions and better flow

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT FORMAT:
Sarah: Welcome everyone to today's episode!
Mike: Thanks Sarah! I'm excited to explore this topic with you.
Sarah: Perfect! So let's dive right in.

ORIGINAL SCRIPT:
{original_script}

Please rewrite this as an engaging, interactive conversation between Sarah and Mike. Use the exact format shown above - each speaker on their own line with "Sarah:" or "Mike:" at the beginning. Keep the same factual content but make it much more dynamic and balanced."""
