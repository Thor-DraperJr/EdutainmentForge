🎙️ Major Release: Azure OpenAI Integration & Multi-Voice TTS Fixes

## ✨ New Features

### 🤖 Azure OpenAI Integration
- **AI-Enhanced Dialogue**: Integrated Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) for intelligent script enhancement
- **Balanced Conversations**: AI transforms monologue content into engaging 50/50 dialogue between Sarah and Mike
- **Interactive Enhancements**: Added natural interruptions, follow-up questions, and conversational flow
- **Smart Table Processing**: Specialized AI enhancement for table content with comparative discussions

### 🎯 Enhanced Multi-Voice TTS
- **Distinct Voice Mapping**: Fixed voice configuration to ensure Sarah (AriaNeural) and Mike (DavisNeural) use different voices
- **Improved Script Parsing**: Enhanced dialogue parsing to properly recognize multiple speakers
- **Post-Processing Pipeline**: Added script cleaning to remove markdown formatting and replace symbols

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 🔧 Audio Quality Issues
- **Asterisk Fix**: Eliminated TTS saying "asterisk" by replacing symbols with pronounceable words
- **Voice Separation**: Fixed issue where both hosts used the same voice
- **Dialogue Segmentation**: Resolved parsing issues that caused scripts to be treated as single narrator segments

### 📝 Content Processing
- **Text Cleaning**: Enhanced content fetcher to remove markdown artifacts and HTML entities
- **Symbol Replacement**: Automatic conversion of technical symbols to spoken words
- **Format Standardization**: Consistent dialogue format enforcement for reliable TTS processing

## 🔒 Security & Production Readiness

### 🛡️ Secure Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: All secrets moved to environment variables (no hardcoded credentials)
- **Azure Key Vault Support**: Production-ready secret management integration
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

### ☁️ Azure Deployment
- **Container Apps**: Updated Azure Container App deployment with new environment variables
- **Docker Optimization**: Enhanced Dockerfile with proper secret handling
