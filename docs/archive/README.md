# Documentation Archive

This folder contains specialized documentation that may be useful for advanced deployments but is not essential for basic setup:

## Files

> Archived detailed guides (cost optimization, container management, CI setup, secure deployment) were removed during repository simplification. Relevant active practices are now summarized in top-level docs under `infrastructure/` and `docs/`.

## Usage

These guides are preserved for reference but represent specialized use cases. For standard deployment, refer to the main documentation in the parent `docs/` folder.
