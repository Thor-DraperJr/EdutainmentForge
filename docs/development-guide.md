# EdutainmentForge Development Guide

This is the comprehensive development guide for building the MS Learn to Podcast application.

## Project Vision

Convert Microsoft Learn content into engaging, edutainment-style podcasts through an iterative development approach with early interactive prototypes.

## Development Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] Project setup with proper folder structure
- [ ] MS Learn content fetching prototype
- [ ] Basic text-to-speech implementation
- [ ] End-to-end vertical slice (MVP)

### Phase 2: Interactivity
- [ ] Simple interactive UI
- [ ] Content selection interface
- [ ] Audio playback controls
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- [ ] Multiple module support
- [ ] Script formatting for edutainment
- [ ] Audio post-processing (music, effects)
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Polish
- [ ] User experience refinement
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Deployment preparation

## Technical Architecture

### Content Pipeline
1. **Fetch**: Retrieve content from MS Learn API/scraping
2. **Process**: Clean and format content for audio conversion
3. **Script**: Transform into engaging podcast script
4. **Generate**: Convert to speech using TTS services
5. **Post-process**: Add music, effects, and polish

### Key Components
- `src/content/`: Content fetching and processing
- `src/audio/`: TTS and audio manipulation
- `src/ui/`: User interface and interaction
- `src/utils/`: Shared utilities and configuration

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end workflows
- **Interactive Tests**: Manual UI/UX validation
- **Performance Tests**: Load and resource usage validation

## Quality Assurance

- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Code review process for all changes
- Regular demos and user feedback sessions
- Performance monitoring and optimization

For detailed implementation guidelines, see the individual component documentation in this directory.
